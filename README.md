# Welcome To My Portfolio!

### About Me

I'm a game developer with 5+ years of experience in VR Game Development and one shipped title with one shipped Mobile App (as a non game developer). I graduated with a Bachelors of Computer and Information Sciences at Auckland University of Technology in 2015. I have experience using the Unity Game Engine, and have worked with C#, Java, C++, Android, Objective-C, and Multiplayer using Photon Unity Networking 1,2 and Photon Fusion.

This webpage will show all the things I've worked on but I also wanted to challenge myself to learn web development, so this is also part of my portfolio (in a way).

I never had an interested in programmer as a child or anything like that but I also was not sure on what I wanted to do in life, but it was definitely my interest in games that has made me become a programmer, I started off learning from a youtube tutorial on some basics about Java and was amazed about how everything worked, so much so that I ended up going to Unversity to get a degree and here I am today!

I love games! I also would love to create the best and most fun games playable, I love trying all sorts of games to give myself different ideas on how I would approach creating fun and interesting games to play.
