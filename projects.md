### Unannounced Project Phase Matrix [Unity3d]

I'm currently working with a group of friends on a non-vr game. I've been given the role of lead developer and have handled majority of the game play features. The little detail I can give so far is that the game is a multiplayer rogue-like action rpg. The player's has a unique action system in which they can define their attacks and are able to combo into said attacks. The player's stats are from the equipment they have and the attacks they have selected.

I've been working on this game in my spare time, whenever I can, it gives me motivation to learn new skills. I've so far ventured into learning about setting up UI in a concise way, along with general UI things I've never experimented before such as drag and drop inventory slots. I've also learnt to use Photon's new Fusion system for multiplayer.

### This website!

I decided that I wanted to learn how to put together a very basic website to show off the work I've done over the years, So I did just that! I'm using Jekyll which let me pick a premade template, from that I shuffled around a couple things and eventually we have this website! I learnt quite a bit about how websites work from this little experimentm, and hopefully it will be useful in the future. 

I also picked Jekyll since I was able to have Github handle all the in between of generating the website from the git repository. Howver aside from that Jekyll let's you setup a website and host it on your own pc, so you can see all your changes in real time, it definitely helped me a lot when designing the website.

### Side Project Town Management VR Game [Unity3d]

Prior to working on Redemption's Guild and during the time I was looking for a job, I worked on a VR Town Management Game. Basically the game consists of two stages, the first stage being the general survival esque genre where the player gathers materials and creates items, crafts objects and such. The second stage would be creating a town for your and AI to live in and survive in, where the AI would be able to do everything the player could, so you would let them to all the mini-games/jobs you didn't like while you got to focus on the ones you liked. This project only go up to the crafting phase, where I experimented with VR, learning the ropes of how things worked.

This was during the very early days of when SteamVR was new, so because of this it was hard to find any sort of example online how to do very basic player interactions, luckily  NetwonVR was in the works and majority of what I did was physics based.

 to a twitter thread I made about the crafting system, it's very rough but it shows the general sense of motivation I had for learning VR Game Development in Unity
