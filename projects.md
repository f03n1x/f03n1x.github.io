### Vin Decoder

Just something I did one day when someone on the my winter car discussion board was talking about getting their ideal Vin plate, and with Toplessgun adding the table, I felt like it was something doable even with my low-calibre knowledge of html. I ended up spending an afternoon on it, learning javascript during the process. Not a fan of javascript but eh it works (personally a fan of programming languages that generally specify data types). 

I've been checking up on the hits from plausible (a site I used mostly to check if companies I applied to actually visited my website) and it's staggering how many people visit without really any advertisement, aside from twice on the discussion board. Really goes to show that word of mouth is really the best way to advertise things. 

Someone asked for a more in-line version close to the vin plate, and I ended up making it a few hours before the new year haha, and seems to do well, I wanted to keep the original just because I personally am used to it now and it seems that it was a good idea, some people jump back to it. Added fireworks for the new year, but took them away, just wait until chinese new year for them to make a return visit!


### This website!

I decided that I wanted to learn how to put together a very basic website to show off the work I've done over the years, So I did just that! I'm using Jekyll which let me pick a premade template, from that I shuffled around a couple things and eventually we have this website! I learnt quite a bit about how websites work from this little experimentm, and hopefully it will be useful in the future. 

I also picked Jekyll since I was able to have Github handle all the in between of generating the website from the git repository. However aside from that Jekyll let's you setup a website and host it on your own pc, so you can see all your changes in real time, it definitely helped me a lot when designing the website.

I am using the <a href="https://github.com/pages-themes/midnight">Midnight Theme</a> made by <a href="https://twitter.com/mattgraham">Matt Graham</a>

### Side Project Town Management VR Game [Unity3d]

Prior to working on Redemption's Guild and during the time I was looking for a job, I worked on a VR Town Management Game. Basically the game consists of two stages, the first stage being the general survival-esque genre where the player gathers materials and creates items, crafts objects and such. The second stage would be creating a town for you and your AI to live and survive in, where the AI would be able to do everything the player could, so you would let them to all the mini-games/jobs you didn't like while you got to focus on the ones you liked. This project only got up to the crafting phase, where I experimented with VR, learning the ropes of how things worked.

This was during the very early days of when SteamVR was new, so because of this it was hard to find any sort of example online how to do very basic player interactions, luckily NetwonVR was in the works and majority of what I did was physics based.

Here is a <a href="https://twitter.com/Arcticfoenix/status/998201957469700099">link </a>
 to a twitter thread I made about the crafting system, it's very rough but it shows the general sense of motivation I had for learning VR Game Development.
