I’m Mark Manson, A VR/Game Developer with over 5 years of experience. I’m an avid gamer, programmer and love to work on games!

My first job in the software development world was working on a mobile app, I handled developing the app for Android and iOS in separate programming languages, talking to the project manager, doing the design, testing the app on both platforms and then upload it to the google play/app store.

Most of my experience comes from my job as a lead programmer at Unlit Games, where I handled quite a lot of the codebase. I also helped out any new programmers that worked with us, understand the systems we have in place and helped them get up to speed and also did some non programmer things such as setting up some of the enemy animator controllers, the animations themselves, and even did some very basic animations in Unity3D.

I spend my time currently working on a game called Caravanguard with a group of friends. I'm the lead developer for this project, and have worked on majority of the codebase, with a main focus on the player attacks, interactions and general systems that revolve around the player.

# Work Experience

**Just an added note about my work experience, I've worked and still work with people in different timezones. Redemption's Guild included people with PST/PDT timezone. FabCom includes people with EST/EDT timezone. Both of which are more than 14 hours difference from my own, so I'm definitely fine changing my sleep schedule to match that for any job!**
